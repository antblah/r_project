# Tidy Data Project

This is the project repository for the Tidy Data project created by John Hopkins. Some of the principals implemented are based on the paper ["Tidy Data" by Hadley Wickman](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).

# Intro

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This project aims to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files Included
1. Run_anaysis.R - Code base for the project

2. CodeBook.md - Details information about the variables and transformations used throughout the project

3. README.md - Details general information about the project

## How to Run the Script
1. Download and unzip all datasets from **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**.  Files can  can be [downloaded here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

2.  Open R or RStudio and run the run_analysis.R script. This script will read the data, perform the necessary transformations, and generate the tidy_data.txt file with the tidy data set.
